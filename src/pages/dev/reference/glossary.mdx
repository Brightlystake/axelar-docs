# Axelar Glossary

The purpose of this document is to provide you with a better understanding of the terminology used in the Axelar documentation. 

## Canonical
A canonical token is an interchain token built from an existing token that is available on multiple chains. The token deployed to other chains will be a [Standardized](#standardized) token. There can only be one canonical token for every ERC-20.

## Custom
A custom ERC-20 that can have any features of functionality you desire, deployed by you. It can optionally implement the `IInterchainToken` interface to transfer methods directly on your token.

## Distributor
A role for tokens that has permission to mint and burn.

## Interchain Token
An ERC-20 contract created by the Interchain Token Service or by yourself that is capable of being transferred between block chains. If the contract implements the `IInterchainToken` interface, it will have knowledge of its own TokenManager and will contain transfer methods directly. If it does not implement this interface, you will need to call functions on the TokenManager to transfer the token.

## Interchain Token Service
A contract deployed by Axelar that manages the creation and management of Interchain Tokens and Token Managers.

The Interchain Token Service has an address of [0xF786e21509A9D50a9aFD033B5940A2b7D872C208](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xF786e21509A9D50a9aFD033B5940A2b7D872C208) on all testnet chains,
deployed from the [v0.3.0](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/releases/tag/v0.3.0) release. Deployed addresses can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/blob/main/info/testnet.json).

## Lock/Release
Incoming token transfers will result in the local releasing of locked tokens.

Outgoing token transfers will result in the local locking of tokens on this blockchain by the Token Manager.

## Mint/Burn
Incoming token transfers will result in the local minting of new tokens on this blockchain by the Token Manager.

Outgoing token transfers will result in the local burning of received tokens.

## Operator
A role for a tokenManager who can set the flowLimit of this manager to limit the influx/outflux of token. 

## Standardized
A minimal ERC-20, that implements the `IInterchainToken` and `IStandardizedToken` interfaces and can be deployed by the service. 

## Token Manager
A contract created by the Interchain Token Service that is capable of locking and releasing tokens, or minting and burning them, depending on its type.

Token Managers must be lock/unlock or mint/burn.

## TokenID 
The ID of the linking between tokens. You can obtain this either
* Once for each pre-existing ERC20, as a canonical tokenId (`getCanonicalTokenId(address)`)
* As an `address deployer` with a `bytes32 salt` as a custom tokenId (`getCustomTokenId(address, bytes32)`)
